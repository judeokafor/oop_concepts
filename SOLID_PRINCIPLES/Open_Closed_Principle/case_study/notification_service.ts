/**
 * Suppose there is a NotificationService that helps us send out an email to the end-user.
 *  The gist is self-explanatory.
 * There are 2 classes — EmailService and NotificationService.
 *  NotificationService calls the sendEmail on EmailService.
 */

/**
 * Where this Fails
    The above solution works well, 
    looks clean and produces the desired functional outcome. 
    But the tests fail, and all instances of these services will need to be modified in the code.
    Additionally, what if the code is closed to modification already — for instance,
    what if the base classes are part of a library?
    This is where sticking to the Open/Closed principle aids us.
